					Michigan has alot to prove this season starting from the new Jordan uniform deal to having to start the season ranked 7th nationally .This is Michigans 2nd season under Jim harbaugh which lead an impressive 10-2 season last year
				ending with a blowout win against Florida. Even though michigan is starting the season ranked 7th they still have problems in the quarterback situation. 
				Jake Ruddock ended the last years season with over 3,000 passing yards before leaving michigan for the NFL. Even though there isn't a clear picture on who is going to behind center one thing though is for sure
				Harbaugh has alot of options to choose from.Starting with Alex Malzone who was one of the best passing quarterbacks when he was recuited by Harbaugh, but his inexperience might be the deciding factor between the other 4 quarterbacks.
				True freshman Brandon Peters is by far one of the best freshman quarterback Michigan has seen since the Denard Robinson, but just like Malzone his inexperience will likely be the reason
				he won't start this upcoming season.Next in line is Shane Morris who was supposed to be a superstar at this point of his career but ever since his concussion a few seasons back he hasn't
				lived up to his expectations. Even though he was recuited as a quaterback he will also more than likely try out for wide-reciever while being a number 3 quarterback. John O'Korn was a suprise to Michigan. When Harbaugh became head coach
				for Michigan O'Korn saw an opportunity and took it. He transfered from Houston with 3,117 pasing yard and 28 touchdowns.He will more than likely be one of Harbaugh's top choices than any of the other options he has.Lastly is Wilton Speight which right now looks to be the quarterback to beat. He's improved immensily this offseason, but just as any quarterback he still has room to improve.
				Whether Harbaugh picks O'Korn or Speight either way Michigan will be a better team this year than last year.

		<h1 style = "color:#043066"><u>New Uniforms</u></h1>
		<td> In reality, everything started with a text message. And not to or from Jim Harbaugh's phone. Heisman Trophy winner Charles Woodson, one of the greatest players in Michigan's football history, had an idea. So he reached out to Michael Jordan. 
"I sent Michael a text and I asked him if I had his blessing to bring this up," Woodson said Tuesday in Detroit. "Then I had a conversation with (former interim athletic director) Jim Hackett. We talked it over. He kept an open mind. 
"My (preference) was to go back to Nike. But I thought it'd be even better to have 'Jumpman' with Michigan football. (Hackett) was receptive to it. That got the ball rolling and we took it from there." 
And Tuesday afternoon, the final part of the finished product was officially unveiled. 
Michigan introduced its new football uniforms Tuesday at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant in Detroit. The uniforms, of course, are the first football jerseys that Nike's Jordan Brand has produced for a college football team. 
Michigan's traditional home uniforms aren't all that different than they were a year ago. The team will wear an all-blue jersey with a Big Ten logo on the upper right side and a Nike Jumpman logo on the left. The pants will be maize (or, Nike's "Amarillo") with a Jumpman on the left hip. 
All gloves, socks, shoes, wristbands and everything else will also feature the Jumpman -- as the football program will be "swoosh" free. 
Michigan will once again wear all white uniforms on the road -- as it did a year ago. A white jersey (with the Jumpman logo), white pants and white socks. The shoulders will feature blue and maize stripes, as will the pants. 
Harbaugh said Tuesday that Michigan's all-white look on the road will likely be a permanent thing moving forward. Additionally, Michigan will be wearing a matte finish to its helmet for all games this season, per a Michigan spokesman. 
The last time the Wolverines wore a matte finish on their traditional winged helmet was Jan. 1, 2013 for the Outback Bowl against South Carolina. 
Harbaugh -- who said he approached Hackett about switching to Nike during his second day on the job in January 2015 -- said the first time he heard about the possibility of wearing Jordan Brand gear was from his son, Jay Harbaugh. 
From there -- after Woodson got the ball rolling -- Jordan reached out to Harbaugh himself. And the rest is history. 
"You are with whom you associate. That's always resonated with me," Harbaugh said. "If you are with whom you associate, then we might as well be striving to associate ourselves with humanity's most evolved people. And it's evident here. It's evident when you talk about Jordan, Michael Jordan, Jordan Brand. 
"It's at the highest level." 
The football jerseys will be available for purchase for the first time Saturday at the M Den on State Street in Ann Arbor and on MDen.com. 
As far as everything else goes, Michigan's players started collecting all of their new Jumpman gear Monday. They'll have their full stable of clothing starting next Monday when fall camp opens. 
"It's amazing," Michigan senior corner Jourdan Lewis said. "This is crazy."
